# ThreeCGoL
## _A multi-organism Conway's Game of Life implementation. Constructed as a building block for the upcoming decentralized game, Flourish and Decay._

Welcome! Thanks for checking out this project. If you've been creating long enough, you've ruined something by making it too complicated. So I'm open-sourcing a 3D, multi-organism version of Conway's Game of Life. Enjoy!

Stay tuned for the launch of _Flourish and Decay._ A unique digital, board game
that just so happens to be fully decentralized. Coming soon.

### Flourish and Decay:

Enter the fantastical realm of sentient slime, where players take the role of a sentient slime mold - a complex organism engaged in an epic battle for dominance! Inspired by the iconic 'Conway's Game of Life,' this multiplayer board game blends deck-building mechanics with cunning algorithmic strategy. Assemble your deck of slimy creatures and watch as they decompose your opponents in the heat of battle. From two player duels to five-player mayhem, this game offers a delightful and dynamic gaming experience for all. Sharpen your wits and prepare to conquer the board, for only the most cunning and powerful organism will rise to the top in this battle royale of decomposition and domination!
